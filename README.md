# TandHSensors
This program reads 5 PT100 sensors and 1 relative humidity HIH400 sensor using an Arduino 
board.

ZIP file contains the PWFusion_31865 library (https://github.com/PlayingWithFusion/PWFusion_MAX31865).

Be sure that this library is properly installed as described here: 
https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries

This code can read PT1000 board properly but parameters have to be adjusted properly.
